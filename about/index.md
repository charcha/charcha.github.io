Charcha is an online audio conferencing tool with special added functionalities. As an online audio conferencing tool, it allows a large number of users to connect on an online audio call. A special feature provided by Charcha is synchronized typing (by means of an etherpad). This facilitates notes-taking during an online discussion.

Holding a virtual audio discussion via Internet has been a challenge as the number of participants (in the discussion) increases. Google Hangouts allows a maximum of ten participants at a time in a call. Other products like Talky, VLine also restrict online call participants to a small number. It is this problem that Charcha addresses. With Charcha, a significantly large group (about 200 participants) can hold an online discussion (provided the user has required bandwidth).

Charcha, as a tool, is free and open and is licensed under [GPL](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html). It means that a user has the freedom to use Charcha, view the source code to understand how it works and if necessary customize the tool to suit specific needs. 

Charcha is a collaborative project and not a commercial product. The project is completely volunteer driven. If you wish to contribute to Charcha, you  could do so by means of testing, filing bugs, fixing bugs, documentation and code patches.
